# EVLib
A library for use in FTC projects. Includes state machine framework and guava. Depends on android.

The EVLib library contains many of our helper classes that are used to drive the robot. This is a wrapper above the state machine framework, with helper classes for controlling a variety of hardware.

The state-machine-framework was a general purpose framework with no platform specific code.

Please check the wiki for information on how to use the project. Expect frequent updates to this page and the wiki as this project's documentation is very incomplete.
